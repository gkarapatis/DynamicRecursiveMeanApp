# DynamicRecursiveMeanApp 
Inspired from [Dynamic Forms](https://angular.io/guide/dynamic-form) guide using Template Driven Forms with ngModel directive.

There is a content managment component wherewith we can design forms saving metadata in a mongo database.
Retriving the data we can create the model driven form described above.
